 * expressions (e.g., the set of characters or segments they match) in a form that is easier for
 * subsequent pipeline stages like validation (e.g., {@link NegationListener}) and optimization
 * ({@link ExpressionReducer}) to process.
 *
 * <p>For example, it might convert a {@code STATIC_TEXT} node into an object representing that
 * literal string, a wildcard node into an object representing a character set, or a group node into
 * a structure representing alternation or sequence. This interpretation is crucial for handling
 * complex features like negation and for enabling effective expression reduction.
