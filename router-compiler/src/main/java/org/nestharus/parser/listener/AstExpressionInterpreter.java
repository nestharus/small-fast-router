/**
 * Transforms ANTLR {@link ParseTree} nodes representing route expressions into a simplified,
 * intermediate semantic representation. This representation captures the *meaning* of the
 * expressions (e.g., the set of characters or segments they match) in a form that is easier for
 * subsequent pipeline stages like validation (e.g., {@link AstNegationErrorListener}) and
 * optimization ({@link ExpressionReducer}) to process.
 *
 * <p>For example, it might convert a {@code STATIC_TEXT} node into an object representing that
 * literal string, a wildcard node into an object representing a character set, or a group node into
 * a structure representing alternation or sequence. This interpretation is crucial for handling
 * complex features like negation and for enabling effective expression reduction.
