/**
 * Utility classes for the small-fast-router project.
 *
 * <p>This package contains utility classes for various operations used in the router
 * implementation, including vector operations for SIMD processing and direct memory access
 * utilities.
 *
 * <p>The main classes in this package are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.nestharus.router.utils.VectorUtils} - Utility methods for vector operations
 *       using Java's Vector API
 *   <li>{@link org.nestharus.router.utils.StringAccessUtils} - Utility methods for direct memory
 *       access to String's byte array
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These utilities are designed to be used by the router implementation to improve performance
 * through SIMD operations and direct memory access.
